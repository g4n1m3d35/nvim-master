### Neovim config

Hello, this file contains everything for NeoVim to work correctly, the plugins are in Lua, but using Vimplug as an installer of the plugins, so far it has worked very well for me from time to time you have to update the plugins to work everything correctly in the beginning if you have done everything right you should not have any problem remember to have Nodejs installed, npm, nvm, yarn, and openjdk and it should all work fine for you.
