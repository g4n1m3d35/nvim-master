### Neovim config

Hello I update this configuration always using
vimplug because there are usually several logs when using lazyvim and for those who just start using vim or neovim it can be difficult, until now it is the best thing that I could actulize only using init.vim and it works quite well the idea is to do the same but with lua because I have tried several with lazy and they all bring various problems and the idea is that it is as easy as possible without so many complications.
Thank you
